# machine-learning-challenge
Over a period of nine years in deep space, the NASA Kepler space telescope has been out on a planet-hunting mission to discover hidden planets outside of our solar system. To help process this data, created machine learning models capable of classifying candidate exoplanets from the raw dataset. Preprocessed the raw data Tuned the models Compare the models
